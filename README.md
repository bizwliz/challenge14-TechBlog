# challenge14- Tech Blog

## Description

In this challenge i plan to build a CMS style blog where the user can post about naything tech related and comment on other users posts as well. The end goal is to have a functioning site using Handlebars.js and Heroku for deployment.

unfortunately I am stuck on this code and unable to finish before my due date, but I managed to change the structure, do some refactoring, edit the signup/login code as well as debug and do more refactoring. My code is currently coming up as unresponsive therefore this homework is unfinished. as discouraged as I feel not being able to complete this in time, I hope you can see i have the basic understanding of how to complete this project. And in due time i will complete this, just need more time to debug and process more information. Thank you for taking the time to review my code, feedback would be very much appreciated.
